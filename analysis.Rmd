## Data package

Here you'll need a number of data that I have developped for vietnam. To
install them, you need the package `remote` installed on your system:

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("remote")
```

Then install the following packages:

```{r eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("epix-project/gdpm")
remotes::install_github("epix-project/gadmVN")
remotes::install_github("epix-project/gso")
```

## Surveillance data

Surveillance data from [GDPM](http://vncdc.gov.vn/en) are in the following
package:

```{r}
library(gdpm)
```

To see the list of diseases that are available in the package:

```{r}
diseases
```

If you want hepatitis:

```{r}
hepatitis <- getid(hepatitis)
```

which gives:

```{r}
head(hepatitis)
```

You can see the time range:

```{r}
range(hepatitis$year)
```

You can also see the number of provinces:

```{r}
length(unique(hepatitis$province))
```

39 is the number of provinces that existed in Vietnam in 1980. These provinces
have split since then to reach a number of 63 in 2008. For consistency, we
always use the provinces' definition of the earlier time in the data. For
example, if you are interested in the hepatitis data since 2008 instead of 1980:

```{r}
hepatitis2 <- getid(hepatitis, from = 2008)
```

You can see that, for this time range:

```{r}
range(hepatitis2$year)
```

you know have the 63 provinces that you could expect:

```{r}
length(unique(hepatitis2$province))
```

## Maps of Vietnamese provinces

For handling maps in R, you need the following package:

```{r}
library(sf)
```

Maps for Vietnam from [GADM](https://gadm.org) are in the following package:

```{r}
library(gadmVN)
```

The retrieval of maps here follows the same principle as for the surveillance
data: depending on the date you want, you'll get different maps. For example, if
you want the map of the provinces of Vietnam in 1980:

```{r}
vietnam1980 <- gadm(1980, "provinces")
```

which gives:

```{r}
vietnam1980
```

which is basically a data frame here with one column containing the provinces'
name and another containing the coordinates of the polygons. You can see by the
way that there are 40 provinces. You can plot it:

```{r}
plot(st_geometry(vietnam1980))
```

If, on the contrary, you are intereste in the map of the provinces as they are
today, just use the default values:

```{r}
vietnam <- gadm()
```

which gives 63 polygons:

```{r}
vietnam
```

Note that, compared to the `vietnam1980` data frame, we have here additional
information. As before, we can plot the polygons of the data:

```{r}
plot(st_geometry(vietnam))
```

## Mapping a variable

Let's say now that you want to map the incidence in January 2008. First, you
need to retrieve these values. For that, let's use this package:

```{r}
library(dplyr)
```

And then:

```{r}
hep <- hepatitis2 %>% 
  filter(month == "January", year == 2008) %>% 
  select(province, incidence_hepatitis)
```

which gives:

```{r}
hep
```

Next step, you'll merge this `hep` data frame with the `vietnam` data you got
above, using the `province` variable as the common key between the 2 data frames:

```{r}
hep_map <- left_join(vietnam, hep, by = "province")
```

You can see that the `incidence_hepatitis` variable of the `hep` data frame has
been added to the `vietnam` data frame:

```{r}
hep_map
```

If you want to map the incidence values, simply do

```{r}
plot(hep_map["incidence_hepatitis"])
```

You can twickle the look of the map. I let you look at the help of the function
for that or, even better, at the vignettes of the `sf` package. You can also
aggregate the data of several provinces or plot by region (you'll see that the
regions information in available in the `vietnam` data frame). Let me know if
there are things that you have difficulties doing.

## Population data

In addition to the `dplyr` package, here we'll need the `purrr` package:

```{r}
library(purrr)
```

Socio-demo-economic data from [GSO](https://www.gso.gov.vn/Default.aspx?tabid=217)
are available in the following package:

```{r}
library(gso)
```

There is a huge amount of data in this package and it may not be super easy to
find what you are looking for. To make it easier, load the `content` data frame:

```{r}
data(content)
```

`content` is a big data frame of the metadata of the data:

```{r}
content
```

You can see in particular that data sets are organised by category, which makes
the search a bit easier. You can list the different categories as so:

```{r}
unique(content$category)
```

If you are interested in population sizes, it's likely that what you are looking
for is in the `Population and Employment` category. You can also filter by
subcategory and spatial resolution

```{r}
content %>% 
  filter(category == "Population and Employment", subcategory == "Demography", sp_resolution == "province")
```

It seems that the first or the third data sets could be useful for you, i.e.
`demography_1` and `demography_5` here. To retrieve the data sets:

```{r}
demo1 <- content %>% 
  filter(data_name == "demography_1") %>% 
  pluck("data") %>% 
  first() %>% 
  transmute(year     = year,
            province = province,
            popsize  = 1000 * average_population_thous_pers)
```

which gives:

```{r}
head(demo1)
```

and

```{r}
demo5 <- content %>% 
  filter(data_name == "demography_5") %>% 
  pluck("data") %>% 
  first() %>% 
  transmute(year     = year,
            province = province,
            popsize  = 1000 * total)
```

which gives:

```{r}
head(demo5)
```

Note that the time range of the 2 data sets are not the same:

```{r}
range(demo1$year)
```

and

```{r}
range(demo5$year)
```

If you are interested in the population sizes in 2011:

```{r}
demo1_2011 <- demo1 %>%
  filter(year == 2011) %>% 
  select(-year) %>% 
  arrange(province)
```

and

```{r}
demo5_2011 <- demo5 %>%
  filter(year == 2011) %>% 
  select(-year) %>% 
  na.exclude() %>% # removing Ha Tay
  arrange(province)
```

You can verify that the 2 data sets are actually identical:

```{r}
all(unlist(map2(demo1_2011, demo5_2011, identical)))
```

You can also check the total population size:

```{r}
sum(demo1_2011$popsize)
```

Same as before, the province names in the `gso` package are compatible with
those in the `gdpm` and the `gadmVN` packages, which makes it easy for you to
map the data:

```{r}
pop_map <- left_join(vietnam, demo1_2011, by = "province")
```

and:

```{r}
plot(pop_map["popsize"])
```

or to calculate incidence rates, per 100,000 for example:

```{r}
incidence_rate_map <- vietnam %>% 
  left_join(hep, by = "province") %>% 
  left_join(demo1_2011, by = "province") %>% 
  mutate(incidence_rate = 1e5 * incidence_hepatitis / popsize)
```

and plot it:

```{r}
plot(incidence_rate_map["incidence_rate"])
```
